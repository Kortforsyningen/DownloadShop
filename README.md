# KMS Oci Queue

## Testing
In tests affecting all users the amount of users are reduced to 30 in debug mode.

The debug mode is controlled by the constant: KMS\_OCI\_QUEUE\_DEBUG. (TRUE = is in debug mode).

Some handy commands in order to run tests from CLI and clear data from db:

+ drush eval 'kms\_test\_db\_cleanup\_kms\_oci\_mess()'. Removes data from job and log table and queues.
+ drush eval "kms\_test\_insert\_new\_user\_test(18580)". Create a user with fields (fields that are relevant to KMS OCI Queue) cloned from another user.
